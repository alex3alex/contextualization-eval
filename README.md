# contextualization-eval
A tool for evaluation of contextualization (WSD) based on TWSI 2.0.

Overview
---------------------

The tool evaluates Word Sense Disambiguation performance of a custom WSD system utilizing sentences and word senses (consisting of contextualized word substitutions) from the Turk Bootstrap Word Sense Inventory (TWSI 2.0; https://www.lt.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/de/data/twsi-turk-bootstrap-word-sense-inventory/)

First, it aligns the provided word sense inventory to TWSI senses. The alignment is calculated as the maximum overlap between related terms from a provided word sense to the substitutions from TWSI.
After alignment, it calculates the precision, recall and F-score of the WSD system.



Prerequesites
------------------------

You need to download and extract the TWSI2 dataset: https://www.lt.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/de/data/twsi-turk-bootstrap-word-sense-inventory/

You can extract the sentences as input for your WSD system by yourself or use the provided data (Dataset-TWSI-2.0.csv) in the data/ folder.

Then you can run your contextualization system to get the predictions, and run the evaluation afterwards.



Running evaluation script 
--------------------

This are instructions are for Ubuntu Linux, but the script should work well on Mac OSX and Windows as well (just install required dependencies). 


1. Download the TWSI2 dataset from https://www.lt.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/de/data/twsi-turk-bootstrap-word-sense-inventory/

2. Download the evaluation script:

   - Direct download from GitHub: https://github.com/tudarmstadt-lt/contextualization-eval/raw/master/twsi-evaluation.py
   
   - Clone the git repository:
   
       ```
       git clone https://github.com/tudarmstadt-lt/contextualization-eval.git
       ```

3. Install required components

    ```
    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-pandas
    ```

4. Assign sense IDs to sentences in *data/Dataset-TWSI-2.0.csv* and save them to the file *predictions.csv*
5. 
5. T

5. Run the evaluation:

    ```
    # check parameters
    python twsi_evaluation.py -h

    # evaluate your predictions, based on your word sense inventory
    python twsi_evaluation.py word_sense_inventory.csv predictions.csv
    ```
    
    For evaluation, you need to provide the path to the TWSI 2.0 dataset, if it is not in the same directory as the script.
    You can set it using the '-t' parameter:
    
    ```
    python twsi_evaluation.py -t path-to/TWSI2_complete word_sense_inventory predictions

    ```
    

Results of the evaluations are printed to stdout. Most essential metrics are also printed to stderr. You should see something like this:


```
Evaluation Results:
Correct, retrieved, nr_sentences
25465 	63801 	  142644
Precision: 0.399131675052 	Recall: 0.17852135386 	F1: 0.246700089612
Coverage:  0.447274333305


```

Data Format
---------------



###Input data format: *data/Dataset-TWSI-2.0.csv*
To be able to run different evaluation scripts, the TWSI 2.0 data needs to be converted into a different format. Int the *data/* folder, you will find the transformed TWSI data. 

```
context_id  target-lemma   target_POS  target_position   gold_IDs predicted_IDs  gold_related_words   predicted_related_words context
```
####Example
```
10038908       ability n       160,169 ability@@1              aptitude:2, strength:4, talent:11, comprehension:1, function:2, competence:1, faculty:3, capability:33, capacity:29, skill:19             The following year , Harchester United reached the Semi Finals of the FA Cup and were also promoted back to the Premiership thanks to the fantastic goalscoring abilities of Karl Fletcher . 
1418247        ability n       45,54   ability@@1              aptitude:2, strength:4, talent:11, comprehension:1, function:2, competence:1, faculty:3, capability:33, capacity:29, skill:19             He has also more than once overestimated his abilities or at times is often too na√Øve or cocky which usually results in a disadvantage during battle . 
...
```

###Word Sense Inventory: *data/word_sense_inventory.csv*

The sense inventory should be in two columns. The first column contains the sense identifier, consisting of the word and the sense ID, separated by a separator (default: '_').

```
Word'SEP'SenseID     list,of,related,words
```
####Example
```
mouse_0     mammalian,murine,Drosophila,human,vertebrate
mouse_1     rat,mice,frog,sloth,rodent,koala,rabbit,lizard,cat
mouse_2     joystick,keyboard,monitor,simulation,networks,hardware,cursor,graphics,worm,lab
...
```


### Input sentences: data/twsi-contexts.txt

We provide the contents from TWSI 2.0 in their original format (tab separated).

```
TWSI_SenseID   target_word    surface_form     sentenceID   tokenized_sentence   confidence_score
```
The sentences are tokenized and contain a '\<b\>' tag around the target word. Additionally, the target word and its surface form are listed in separate columns.

####Example
```
ability@@1  	ability  	abilities   	10038908	   The following year , Harchester United reached the Semi Finals of the FA Cup and were also promoted back to the Premiership thanks to the fantastic goalscoring <b>abilities</b> of Karl Fletcher . 	   1.0
```


###Predictions: data/predictions.csv

The predictions contain two columns, first the sentence ID from TWSI, second the sense identifier (same identifier as in the word sense inventory).
If the system was not able to assign a word sense id, this column can be empty.

```
SentenceID     Word'SEP'SenseID
```
####Example
```
17367113	   type_1
17948117	   type_0
19032445	   type_0
19179157	   type_0
19651374	   
22028271	   type_0
22585018	   type_1
```
